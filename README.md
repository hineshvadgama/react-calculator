# React Calculator

A simple calculator that has been built using React.

# Background

Starting from a simple image of a calculator and a few requirements, I implemented the UI, and added logic to make this funtioning calculator.

Two key thing to note is that it doesn't use JavaScript's `eval` function, and that it also follows the mathematics rule of BIDMAS to solve expressions.
